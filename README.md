## DIGITAL LOGIC 📟
Digital logic is the foundation of computing, using Boolean algebra to design electronic circuits with logic gates that perform operations, controlling current flow in devices like computers, smartphones, and microprocessors to process information through combinational logic gates and sequential circuits.Asynchrounous and synchrounous help us know what actually that used in our daily life like lift, vending machine,calculator and more.  

## Lab 1
In Lab 1, I learned how to implement basic logic gates on a breadboard by using specific Integrated Circuits (ICs). For example, the 7408 IC was used for the AND gate, the 7432 IC for the OR gate, and the 7404 IC for the NOT gate. By correctly connecting these ICs with GND and VCC, switch(input) and Led(output).I was able to observe the behavior of each logic gate in real hardware. Although only three basic gates were used, I successfully combined them to construct a more complex combinational logic circuit. This lab enhanced my understanding of how theoretical logic gate concepts are translated into practical hardware implementations and improved my hands-on skills in circuit wiring and troubleshooting.

## Lab 2
In Lab 2, I learned how to download and use the Deeds Simulator to design and simulate digital logic circuits. Deeds allows logic circuits and timing diagrams to be created and tested without manually drawing them on paper. By simply adjusting the input bits during simulation, the output can be observed automatically in real time. This tool greatly improves efficiency and reduces human error when analyzing circuit behavior. However, one limitation of Deeds is that it does not explicitly display the “don’t care” condition as a special symbol. Instead, don’t care inputs may appear as either 0 or 1. Since these conditions are logically impossible or irrelevant, they can be ignored during analysis. When constructing Karnaugh maps, the don’t care terms are still included to get a more simplified Boolean expression. Overall, this lab strengthened my understanding of logic simplification and demonstrated how simulation tools support digital circuit design.
